**Working Notebooks:**
- **yamnet original.ipynb:** YAMNet model into a Sequential model
  - accuracy ~93% 
- **yamnet with lstm.ipynb:** YAMNet model into a Sequential model using an LSTM layer
  - slightly better accuracy than original (~95.5%)
- **yamnet (using tutorial and folds).ipynb:** YAMNet model into a Sequential model using Google's tutorial
  - low accuracy (around 67%)

- **vggish.ipynb:** VGGish model into a Sequential model using an LSTM layer
  - accuracy around 88% but a very large model
